This ocio.config is basicaly the nuke-default config which can be downloaded from
**http://opencolorio.org/configurations/index.html** but extended with the **sRGB_SPI**
color transform that describes an srgb transformation with an s-curve applied.


Why sRGB_SPI? Why this s-curve?
-------------------------------

The intended use is to fake in the higher dynamic range of the real world into the
images displayed on an RGB low dynamic range display device (for example a monitor).
