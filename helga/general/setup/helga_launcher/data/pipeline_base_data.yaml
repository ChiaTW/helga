#Here is the **ONLY** place in the pipeline where we have hardcoded pipeline variables.
#The variables here are **ONLY** used when the executable isnt run with the argv on the
#command line. (In other terms they are only used when len(sys.argv) != 5).
#The order of the command line arguments when using with shortcuts is as the order below.
