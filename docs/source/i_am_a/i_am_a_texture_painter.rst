	Quick description of the most important things for a texture painter.



I am a texture painter
======================

.. note::
	| Hi Marco, you radical machine!
	| Here is a quick summary of the important things for you...

-----------------------

Where to put your Mari, Mudbox projects or PS files?
----------------------------------------------------

	| Please work on your textures in this folder
	| **Y:/Production/3d/maya/scenes/assets/work/chars/CHARACTERNAME/textures**
	| **Y:/Production/3d/maya/scenes/assets/work/props/PROPNAME/textures**
	| 
	| **Please version up like this:**
	| ulfbert_textures_a_0001_mh.mra
	| ulfbert_textures_a_0002_mh.mra
	| ulfbert_textures_b_0003_mh.mra
	| ...
	| chimney_textures_e_0005_mh.mud
	| chimney_textures_f_0006_mh.mud

-----------------------

Where to put the textures for the shading artist to use?
--------------------------------------------------------

| Please put the textures you want Manuel (or me) to use in
| **Y:/Production/3d/maya/scenes/assets/textures/CHARACTERNAME**
| 
| Please name them without version (this is called *publishing* in fancy TD speech): 
| bump.1001.tga
| bump.1002.tga
| ...
| color.1001.tga
| color.1002.tga
| ...
| etc.
| 
| It is just important, that you overwrite your older files and dont version here, so that the
| textures that are used in the shaders update themselves.

-----------------------

What formats for textures?
--------------------------

	| Simply put: Everything is **.tga** except displacement maps which are **.exr**
	| and maps from photoscan which are **.jpg**
	| :ref:`Here is a link to our formats and standards <formats_and_standards>`
