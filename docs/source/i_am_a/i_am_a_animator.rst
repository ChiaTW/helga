I am a animator
===============

**Hey animation crew, here is a quick overview of the what, where and how within
the *helga* animation pipeline. Dont be scared, we try to make life for you as easy as
possible!
Please risk a quick look at these points, and in a spin you should be ready to animate :D**


----------------------------------

Who can help if there are problems?
-----------------------------------

| **Direction:** `Marco <mailto:marco.hakenjos@filmakademie.de?Subject=[helga]%20Animation%20question>`_
| **Animation:** `Cindy <mailto:cynthia.delongcollins@gmail.com?Subject=[helga]%20Animation%20question>`_
| **Rigs:** `Hanna <mailto:hanna.binswanger@filmakademie.de?Subject=[helga]%20Rig%20issue>`_  and `Arash <mailto:s.arashhosseini@gmail.com?Subject=[helga]%20Rig%20issue>`_
| **Pipeline:** `Timm <mailto:wagenertimm@gmail.com?Subject=[helga]%20TD%20mongo>`_
| 
**Dont be afraid to ask as often as possible! Remember: Some TDs look more grim than they really are ;D**


----------------------------------


Where do i get those rigs?
----------------------------------------------------

	| You can find them here:
	| **Y:/Production/3d/maya/scenes/assets/chars**
	| 
	| **Important:** If the rigs are not there or do not behave as expected please
	| dont fix this yourself or grab them from another location.
	| Instead please ask our riggers `Hanna <mailto:hanna.binswanger@filmakademie.de?Subject=[helga]%20Rig%20issue>`_  and
	| `Arash <mailto:s.arashhosseini@gmail.com?Subject=[helga]%20Rig%20issue>`_, since its their responsibility
	| to supply you with correct working material (and also they are sick experts in the biz of rigging...much more than u and me)


----------------------------------


Where are the shots?
----------------------------------------------------

	| **Y:/Production/3d/maya/scenes/shots**


----------------------------------


Why is everything an **asset** and not just a model or rig?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	| Assets are nothing special, they are just models and rigs that meet special
	| criteria. An asset has metadata for example to guarantee that it will
	| export correctly for the lighting dudes.
	| The general idea is, that everything you animate (Set, Characters and Props)
	| is an asset so a smooth functioning is guaranteed. 


----------------------------------


I want an additional asset in my shot. How?
----------------------------------------------------

	| You need another beer bottle or an empty glass to get the perfect framing?
	| Its totally fine to reference another asset in your shot, as long as you
	| grab them from here:
	| **Y:/Production/3d/maya/scenes/assets/props**
	| 
	| Those assets have been messed with by a `TD <mailto:wagenertimm@gmail.com?Subject=[helga]%20TD%20mongo>`_ and are guaranteed to export 
	| correctly to lighting, simulation etc.
	| If the asset you need isnt there, just ask me and i will try to add it.


----------------------------------


Preroll?
----------------------------------------------------

	| After animation is approved, the simulation department (`Johannes <mailto:johannes.franz@filmakademie.de?Subject=[helga]%20Simulation%20issue>`_)
	| will do its thing. 
	| In order for them to do a good job, you need to supply them with a so called
	| **Resting Pose**. The resting pose basically is a T-Pose that blends linear into
	| your first frame of animation. You can read more about it :ref:`here <animation_checklist>`.
