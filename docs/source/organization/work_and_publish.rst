Work and Publish
==================

Our system of **work** and **publish** explained. It is **really** as simple as copying and overwriting your work at the right locations, so dont be afraid ;)

---------------

Separate work and publish locations
-----------------------------------

This is just the simple principle that you manage what you give to production.
Fellow coworkers never see your *messy*  workspaces and only grab the content that you have
published for them to use. 

.. important::
	
	If the object you want to use is **not** published, then **dont** just use a version from
	the responsible persons workspace. Instead **ask** the person for the content.

In many locations you will find a work folder which might contain the same folderstructure where itself is in for example :

::
	
	3d/maya/scenes/assets/ <-- This is where people USE your work
		chars
		props
		cameras
		...
		**work**

	3d/maya/scenes/assets/work <-- This is where people work
		chars
		props
		cameras
		...

Here is an example for concept artists, to show that this principle is not limited to 3d :

::
	
	2d/concept_art <-- This is where people watch work
		chars/
			ulfbert/
				ulfbert_concept_hair <-- People go here to WATCH the latest ulfbert hair concept
		props
		...
		**work**

	2d/concept_art/work <-- This is where people work
		chars
			ulfbert/
				ulfbert_concept_hair_a_0001_mh.psd <-- People go here to CREATE the latest ulfbert hair concept
				ulfbert_concept_hair_b_0002_mh.psd
				...
		props
		...
