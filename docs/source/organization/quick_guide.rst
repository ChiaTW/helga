	Cornerstones of how we organize our work



Quick Guide
==================

.. note::
	
	Here is a quick cheat sheet of how we be rollin. In 95% of all cases you do the right thing when you follow these simple rules.

---------------

1. **Communicate!**
	If you are unsure, dont do it. Talk to the person that knows!!!
2. **If you dont know, and nobody is there to tell you: Use your rnd folder.**
3. **Use the naming convention**
	To let people will know who is responsible, what is the latest version etc.
	Read about it :ref:`here <naming_convention>`
4. **Your work is not done when your work is done!**
	Your work is done when you correctly gave it to the coworker who uses it next (Publishing/Copying/Overwriting).
5. **Workspace and Publishing**
	This is the system that builds upon the former rule. Work in your workspace and give it to your coworkers when its ready (publish). Read more about it :ref:`here <work_and_publish>`.
	Much of the work your coworkers do depends on you being clean and organized (rig references for animators, texture references for shading artists, matte painting references for comp artists).
6. **Work clean and dont rush! If you dont work clean, you cause somebody else more work.**
7. **Never reference/use something from a work directory**
