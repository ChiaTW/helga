I am a texture painter
======================

.. note::
	| Hi Natalia :D
	| Here is a quick summary of the important things for you...

-----------------------

Where to put your Mari projects?
--------------------------------

	| Please work on your textures in this folder
	| **Y:/Production/3d/maya/scenes/assets/work/chars/CHARACTERNAME/textures**
	| 
	| Please version up like this:
	| ulfbert_textures_a_0001_nf.mra
	| ulfbert_textures_a_0002_nf.mra
	| ulfbert_textures_b_0003_nf.mra
	| ...

-----------------------

Where to put the textures for the shading artist to use?
--------------------------------------------------------

| Please put the textures you want Manuel (or me) to use in
| **Y:/Production/3d/maya/scenes/assets/textures/CHARACTERNAME**
| 
| Please name them without version (this is called *publishing* in fancy TD speech): 
| bump.1001.tif
| bump.1002.tif
| ...
| color.1001.tif
| color.1002.tif
| ...
| etc.
| 
| It is just important, that you overwrite your older files and dont version here, so that the
| textures that are used in the shaders update themselves.

-----------------------

What formats for textures?
--------------------------

	| As you wished, **.tif** should be just fine.
	| Only displacement maps will be 32bit float **.exr** files.
