The content i'm producing right now doesnt seem to fit anywhere. Where should i save it?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Please save it in your rnd folder. It can be integrated into production later, when a good place for your content is found.

Is it a good idea to use different versions of our pipeline softwares (For example Maya 2015 instead of Maya 2014) in order to solve a problem?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	No.

I am making a GUI tool for Maya. Should i use PySide or PyQT?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Almost always PySide is the right choice, due to better licensing and the fact that it comes embedded.
